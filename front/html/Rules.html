The game can only be played with 2 players, 1 versus 1.
Player A starts on any column of line 1 ; Player B starts on any column of line 9.
During the game, the cell the player A is on, and the 4 adjacent cells have a +1 visibility;
the cell the player B is on, and the 4 adjacent cells have a -1 visibility
Walls are 2 cells long and can be placed between cells; each player starts with 10 Walls
Each cell in contact with a Wall placed by player A gets +2 visibility; Each cell that is 1
cell away from a Wall placed by player A gets +1 visibility.
• Each cell in contact with a Wall placed by player B gets -2 visibility; Each cell that is 1
cell away from a Wall placed by player B gets -1 visibility.
• The visibility modifiers are cumulative.
Player A can only see the cell it’s on, and the cells that have a visibility score of at
least 0; Player B can only see the cell it’s on, and the cells that have a visibility score
of at most 0.
• A player can see the other player if it is 1 cell away or if it is on a visible cell.
• Players don’t know the visibility value of a cell; they just know if they can see it.
• Players can see all the walls.
The goal for Player A is to reach line 9; Player B has to reach line 1.
• Player A plays first.
• If Player A reaches line 9 first, Player B has one move to try and reach line 1. If player B
succeeds, the game ends in a draw ; otherwise, Player A wins.
• If Player B reaches line 1 first, the game ends with Player B victory.
• When it’s a player’s turn, the options are:
• Placing a wall somewhere it doesn’t make it impossible for any player to reach the end,
• Moving 1 cell in a cardinal direction. Notes:
• Players can’t jump over walls
• Players can jump over players
• Players cannot skip their turn unless they have no actions available.
• After 100 turns from both players (200 in total), the game ends in a draw.
